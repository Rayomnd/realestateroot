This is the one of my Ruby on Rails web apps.
The idea of creating this website is because I see the idea of torrentroot.com provide a convenient way to get the results from multiple torrent sites. 
So you don't need to spend time search other torrent sites to find your desired items. And the realestateroot can provide the information by searching from multiple reals states sites, such as trulia, zillow, yahoo, century21, realtor, and homes. 

The website is down because we are afraid one of these websites may sue us for using their data.
